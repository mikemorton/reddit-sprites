A couple of scripts I use for managing the user flair on [/r/sports](http://www.reddit.com/r/sports).

**output.py** is used for generating imagelist.txt, a list of all images that should be used in the sprite.

**combine.py** reads from imagelist.txt and generates a CSS sprite based on the contents.
